I mean, it's interesting, but it's not like Iï¿½ll need to know about the Pharaohs to fix a computer. I ended up playing basketball with Max after school. It helps me clear my head. We totally destroyed the other team; well, it was just us and some younger kids, but still. I like these moments. Mom keeps bugging me about my grades. Sheï¿½s not happy with Bs. I wish she knew how hard it is to balance everything.",0,251,0,0.2506524

I wish school was more like thatï¿½learning cool stuff instead of repeating the same boring things. Dad says I need to 'apply myself,' but it's hard when nothing really captures my interest.

Schoolï¿½s been a lot lately; the pressure is getting to me. I tried explaining it to Dad, but he says itï¿½s nothing compared to his work stress. Doesnï¿½t he get that itï¿½s still stressful for me?

Iï¿½ve been getting better at basketball too; less stress about the free throws. I think practicing with Max more often has really paid off.

I painted for a bit last night after finishing my homeworkï¿½working on a piece inspired by the ocean. Swimming has always been my escape, but with winter coming, the pool feels less appealing.

Had some time to paint before heading to school; the colors feel like an extension of my emotions. Geometry test todayï¿½yikes. I told Mom I was worried about it, and she gave me a big hug and said I could do it. Her confidence in me helps more than she knows. Dad is taking me to a new art exhibit this weekend.

Ms. Bailey asked if I thought about college yetï¿½whoa, slow down! Everyone has these high expectations, and it feels overwhelming. Yet, painting helps.

Weï¿½re all in the same boat, I guess.",0,264,0,0.30804747

27,"8:00 PM, Winding down now. Dance practice went smoothly, and I feel stronger, both mentally and physically. I had this realization today that itï¿½s okay not to have everything figured out. Thereï¿½s time. Mom and Dad have been less intense about my future lately, more supportive of what I want to do now.

Mrs. Lopez said I have talent, which made me smile. After school, I skated until it got dark. Itï¿½s the best way to clear my head. Javier came over, and we played video games.

I painted a new picture after school - a landscape with mountains and a river. It felt good, but something is missing. Maybe I just need more practice. I wish I had more time for dance; lately, Iï¿½ve felt disconnected from it. Dad said we might visit Grandma this weekend, and that makes me happy. Grandma always knows how to make me feel better.

My history teacher pulled me aside today to tell me I need to focus more. Easier said than done, right? Skateboarding took my mind off things for a bit. There's just something freeing about it.

Basketball practice was a mixed bag. Coach was on my case about footwork, which totally annoyed me. But we also had some great plays. Spent the evening skateboarding; even tried filming some tricks. Kinda fun. Dinner was just takeoutï¿½standard. Miss having a proper meal with family. Wonder if things will ever change. Not sure what to hope for.",0,1025,0,0.26356637

At recess, I tried talking with my friends again. It felt weird, but in a good way. They seemed happy to have me back. Came home and sat at the piano. Played through a whole song without stopping. It felt good. Later, I tried painting a little too. The colors didnï¿½t seem as dull. Maybe things are starting to change. I hope this feeling stays.",1,2277,0,0.46020314

Paid attention in class and even participated in a discussion. My friends seemed surprised but happy. Played a piece for Mom on the piano. She looked so glad. We had dinner together, and it didnï¿½t feel awkward. I even found myself laughing at one of Dad's jokes. Itï¿½s been a while since dinner wasn't a lonely affair.

During art class, I enjoyed mixing colors again. My teacher even commented on my work, saying it was vibrant. It made me feel proud. Came home and played the piano for an hour. Practiced a new piece and didnï¿½t make too many mistakes. I feel like Iï¿½m re-discovering parts of myself. Still have some sad moments, but not as many as before. Maybe thereï¿½s hope after all.",1,2279,0,0.14041932

My grades are dropping and I can see the teachers getting frustrated. Football used to be my escape, but now it feels like a burden. The guys on the team notice something's off, but I canï¿½t explain it. Home's quiet too. Mom's working extra hours; I barely see her. Dadï¿½s not around much, and when he is, we donï¿½t talk. Feels like I'm drifting, and I donï¿½t know how to change that. I'm tired of it all.",0,2282,0,0.14285587

Usually, gamingï¿½s my way to forget everything, but now itï¿½s just another reminder. Even listened to some of my favorite rap songs, which usually lifts my mood, but today they felt like noise. My friends texted me, but I didnï¿½t reply. Donï¿½t have the energy to hang out. Life feels like itï¿½s on pause, and I'm stuck in the same scene. Nights are the worst, though.

Went to the roof during lunch, needed to be alone. Itï¿½s peaceful up there, even in the city noise. Mom got home late again, looked exhausted. Tried talking to her, but it's like weï¿½re on different planets. Played some football alone in the yard, wasnï¿½t fun. My rap lyrics arenï¿½t flowing anymore either. Every idea seems clichï¿½. My life feels like itï¿½s falling apart piece by piece.",0,2284,0,0.13015546

He thinks I can do better, but I donï¿½t know how to tell him that itï¿½s not that simple. Coach benched me today because I missed too many practices. That hurt. Football was my thing, and now Iï¿½m losing that too. Talked to my buddy Jay after school, heï¿½s worried. I appreciate it, but even he canï¿½t get through to me. Spent the night in my room. Tried to write some rap verses, but it all felt forced.",0,2285,0,0.12373556

More zeros piling up. Feels like Iï¿½m drowning. Played some video games to escape, but it only worked for a bit. Listened to some old rap legends for inspiration, but nothing clicked. Went for a walk around the neighborhood, hoping fresh air would clear my head. It didnï¿½t. Everything feels heavy, and I donï¿½t see a way out.

For the first time in a while, we had a decent chat. Played some video games and it was fun again. Even worked on some new rap lyrics. Theyï¿½re not perfect, but thereï¿½s something there. Maybe things can change.",1,2287,1,0.6141033

Heï¿½s giving me a chance to make up some assignments. It's going to be tough, but I want to try. Chilled with Jay after school. We joked around and played video games, and it felt normal, like old times. In the evening, listened to some rap tracks and felt a spark of inspiration. Wrote a few lines. Not everythingï¿½s perfect yet, but thereï¿½s a glimmer of hope now.",1,2288,1,0.65398395

Came home and helped Mom with dinner. We talked a bit, nothing heavy, just little things. It was nice. Listened to some new rap tracks for inspiration, and laid down some beats of my own. The creative block is lifting. Feeling more positive about the future.",1,2290,1,0.62298214

Didnï¿½t feel like a chore for once. Mom made my favorite lunch, and we laughed about some silly stuff. Spent the afternoon gaming, reached a new level and it felt good.

I go to practice, but my movements feel heavy, like I'm dragging myself through each step. Mom and Dad notice, but they just keep asking if everythingï¿½s okay. I donï¿½t know how to explain. School doesnï¿½t make sense either. My grades are dropping because I canï¿½t concentrate. During breaks, I sit alone and try to read, but the words blur together.

Ended up crumpling the paper and feeling worse. Danced alone in the yard after school, but it wasnï¿½t like before. My movements were off, and it frustrated me. Mom cooked my favorite dinner, but I barely tasted it. Dad tried to talk about his day, but I couldnï¿½t engage. They know somethingï¿½s wrong, but I canï¿½t find the words.

The instructor asked if I was feeling okay. I forced a smile, but my moves were sluggish. Tried drawing a picture of our backyard, but nothing came out right.

After school, I tried reading, but my mind kept wandering. Drew a few sketches, but they all looked wrong. Mom asked if I wanted to talk, but I just shrugged.

Normally, Iï¿½d lose myself in the game, but now itï¿½s like a reminder of how everythingï¿½s going wrong. Got home and tried playing video games, but couldnï¿½t escape the emptiness. My drawings look lifeless, like Iï¿½m trying to capture something thatï¿½s no longer there. Mom and Dad know somethingï¿½s wrong, but I donï¿½t know how to talk about it.
