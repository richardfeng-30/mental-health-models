      "I don't really know why I'm writing this, but I'll give it a shot. Today was kind of a mess. I had a basketball game, and we lost. Again. It feels like everything I try doesn't work out. Even drawing isn't as fun anymore. Video games used to be my escape, but now they just stress me out. I wish things were different, but I don't know how to change anything. I feel like no one really listens to me or understands what I'm going through.",
      "School was terrible today. I failed my math test, and my teacher gave me the 'I'm disappointed in you' look. I swear, no one gets how hard it is. It�s like they expect me to be perfect or something. When I got home, my mom asked about my day, but I didn't want to talk. What�s the point? She tries, I guess, but talking doesn't help. Played some video games, hoping to escape, but I kept losing. Everything seems pointless.",
      "This morning was a disaster. I couldn't find my PE clothes, and I had to wear something else that made me look stupid. Of course, everyone at school noticed and laughed. Why can't I just get one thing right? I was looking forward to drawing after school, but I just didn't feel inspired. Even picking up the pencil seemed like too much effort. I wish I didn't care so much about what people think of me. But I do. And it sucks.",
      "Another long day. We had basketball practice, and I couldn�t make a single shot. My coach yelled at me in front of the whole team. It was so embarrassing. I try so hard, but nothing seems to work. My friends didn't even notice I was upset. I guess everyone's too focused on their own stuff. Played some video games when I got home, but even that felt annoying. I kept thinking about all the things that went wrong today. I'm so tired of feeling like this.",
      "Woke up late, so the day started off badly. Missed the bus and had to walk to school. Got into trouble for being late, of course. It feels like I'm always in trouble or doing something wrong. Spent lunch alone in the art room again. Drawing used to make me happy, but now it just reminds me of all the things I'm bad at. Watched some YouTube videos, trying to distract myself, but they just made me feel worse. Why does everything have to be so hard?"

      "Today wasn't as bad as usual. I didn't totally suck at basketball practice, which was a nice change. My coach didn�t yell at me, and I even managed to score a few points. At school, the math lesson was confusing, but I think I understood more than usual. Drawing was kind of fun again. I made something that wasn�t terrible, and that felt pretty good. It�s not a big change, but I�ll take what I can get.",
      "I don't know if today was better or if I'm just getting used to things. I didn't fail anything at school, which was a surprise. My mom and I actually talked a bit, and it didn't feel forced. Played video games in the evening, and it was kind of fun. I didn't win any big matches, but I didn't lose all of them either. Baby steps, I guess. Maybe things can get better, at least a little bit.",
      "Today was strange. I got a decent grade on my history project, which was unexpected. My friends were actually nice today. We laughed a lot, which hasn�t happened in a while. I even felt like drawing something fun after school. It wasn�t amazing, but I didn't hate it. For the first time in a while, the day didn�t feel like a total disaster. Maybe there�s hope after all. Or maybe I�m just fooling myself. I don't know.",
      "Not the best day, but not the worst either. Basketball practice wasn't a complete nightmare. School was boring, but at least I didn't have to deal with any major drama. Tried to draw something after school, and it came out alright. Played video games and didn�t get too frustrated. Talked to my dad for a bit when he got home. It was awkward, but it felt good to be heard, even just a little. Small wins?",
      "I think I'm feeling a bit better these days, but I�m not sure. School is still hard, and I still hate math, but I didn't fail my latest quiz. That�s progress, right? Hung out with my friends after school, and we had a few good laughs. Drawing was actually kind of relaxing tonight. I don�t know what changed, but things don�t feel as heavy. I hope it lasts, but I'm scared it won�t. One day at a time."

I love reading, but even that can't distract me from how I feel right now. Dancing used to bring me so much joy, but lately, I just can't get into it. Painting is almost pointless. I'm always so worried about everything that I can't even create. I feel trapped in a loop of negativity.",
      "Today was rough. My mom and dad try their best to support me, but I can't shake this feeling of hopelessness. I didn't do well on my chemistry test, and now I'm worried about my grades. I read for a bit after school, but my mind kept wandering back to my problems. Dancing class was a disaster; I couldn't get the steps right. After that, I tried painting to calm down but ended up ruining the canvas. I just want one good day where everything goes right.",
      "Woke up this morning feeling already tired. Spilled breakfast all over myself, so that was a great start. At school, my friends were being their usual cheerful selves, and it just made me feel worse. It's like they don't understand how difficult things are for me. Tried to lose myself in a book during study hall, but couldn't focus. When I got home, I attempted to paint something nice, but nothing came out right. Dancing felt more like a chore than a joy. I don't know how to make things better.",
      "It's another one of those days. Barely made it through classes. Everyone seems to be moving forward, leaving me behind. I spent most of my lunch break in the library, trying but failing to enjoy a book. Dancing class was frustrating; I can't seem to keep up with everyone else. Painting doesn't bring me peace anymore; it only reminds me of what I can't do. My parents are always there, trying to help, but I feel like I'm disappointing them too. This weight on my chest doesn't go away.",
      "I had a breakdown today. Everything's just so overwhelming. I snapped at my mom for no reason, and now I feel guilty. School is becoming unbearable. I feel out of place in every class. I tried reading, dancing, and painting throughout the day, hoping something would click, but nothing did. I ended up wasting hours doing nothing productive. My friends keep asking if I'm okay, but I don't even know how to answer them anymore. All I want is for these feelings to stop."

Dancing class was actually fun; I didn�t mess up the new routine completely. When I got home, I painted a small piece, and it didn't turn out terrible. My mom noticed and complimented me, which felt nice. Maybe things can get a little better.",
      "Had an okay day today. I didn't fail the biology quiz, which was surprising. Spent some time with my friends, and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. We even laughed a few times. Dancing class felt good; I got some of the steps right. Decided to start a new painting, and the initial strokes felt promising. There's this slight sense that things might change for the better, and I�m starting to hope.",
      "I'm starting to see small improvements. Today in school, I actually answered a few questions in history class and didn�t second-guess myself. After school, I read for an hour without feeling distracted by worries. Dancing was enjoyable again; I felt like I was flowing with the music. My painting is coming along well and starting to look like what I imagined. My parents seemed happier too, which makes me feel less of a burden. A good day, for once.",
      "It's not perfect, but today�s been better. Managed to stay awake and focused during most of my classes. Reading during lunch was a nice break; I got lost in the book and forgot my worries for a while. Dancing was a bit challenging, but I didn�t mess up too much. The painting I'm working on is almost done, and I'm actually proud of it. My dad and I had a good conversation during dinner, which was rare but nice. Small steps forward, I guess.",
      "I feel like I can breathe again. School went alright; nothing too overwhelming. I actually enjoyed hanging out with my friends after class. They were supportive, and it felt good to be understood. Dancing class was amazing; I nailed a routine I've been struggling with. Finished my painting tonight and my mom loved it. I can see a bit of light at the end of this dark tunnel. I'm nervous it won�t last, but maybe good days can happen more often. One day at a time."

I asked a couple of the guys if they wanted to go swimming over the weekend, but they seemed uninterested. Coding used to be my safe space, but even that�s stressing me out now. Nothing I code works the way I want it to. I feel like I�m failing at everything.",

I avoided eye contact with everyone. In swimming practice, I was slower than everyone else. It�s embarrassing. After dinner, I tried to read a book, but my mind kept wandering. Coding didn�t go well either; I spent hours and got nowhere. I wish I could just be good at something.",
      "What a terrible day. Fell asleep in history class and got in trouble. No one noticed or cared. Hanging out with friends seems impossible when you don�t really have any. I miss the days when swimming was fun and not something I dreaded. I even skipped practice today because I couldn�t face anyone. Tried to code a small project, but everything crashed. Reading doesn�t provide an escape anymore either. It�s like I�m sinking and can�t find a way out.",
      "Woke up this morning feeling like a failure. Struggled to get through school. Every class feels like a marathon. I sit in the back and hope to become invisible. Swimming is becoming less of an enjoyment and more of a chore. All I want to do is read and forget everything, but that�s not helping either. My latest coding project is a mess. I can�t seem to get anything right. My parents keep asking if I�m okay, but I don�t even know how to explain what I�m feeling.",

Reading is the only thing that keeps me sane, but lately, I can�t even concentrate on that. I feel like a ghost, just wandering through the halls. Swimming used to be my escape, but now it�s just another reminder of how out of place I feel. Tried to work on a coding project tonight, but it�s just frustrating.

Talked to my parents at dinner, and it didn�t feel too weird. Small victories seem like a big deal right now.",

Volleyball practice was a disaster; I couldn't hit the ball right and my coach yelled at me. Piano used to be an escape, but my parents' high expectations are crushing any enjoyment I used to have. Photography is pointless when you don't see beauty in anything. I feel like I'm drowning, and there's no one to pull me out.",

My piano practice went terribly; I kept hitting the wrong keys. It's becoming more of a burden than a hobby. Photography usually calms me, but today it just reminded me of how unsatisfied I am with everything. My parents are supportive, but they don�t understand the weight I feel every day. It's suffocating.",
