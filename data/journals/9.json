    "Today was awful. I can't seem to find joy in anything anymore, not even video games. I used to love playing them for hours, but now I just feel numb. School is such a drag; all the teachers do is pile on homework and I don't understand half of it. I'm falling behind, and it feels like no one cares.",
    "I played basketball after school today, but it wasn't fun. I was off my game and kept missing shots. My friends joked about it, but it hurt. I know they're just trying to be funny, but I feel like a loser. It's like I'm watching myself fail at everything I used to be good at.",
    "Mom and Dad are alright, I guess, but they don't understand me. They ask about my day but don't really listen. I tried telling them about my coding project, and they just nodded like it was no big deal. I feel so alone, like I'm in this bubble that no one can penetrate.",
    "Woke up tired today. Didn't wanna get out of bed. Everything just seems pointless. I didn't turn in my history assignment because I couldn't bring myself to care. Why bother? It's not like it will make a difference in my life. Had to face the teacher's disappointed look, which made me feel even worse.",
    "Everything has been so bleak lately. I can't stop the negative thoughts. My friends seem distant, and even though I'm surrounded by people, I feel completely isolated. I don't have the energy to smile or pretend I'm okay anymore. What if things never get better?"

    "I had a good conversation with my dad today. We talked about college and my future. He listened more than usual and didn't just give advice. It was different. Made me think that maybe he does understand me, at least a little more than I gave him credit for.",
    "Had a surprising day. One of my teachers praised my history essay. I felt an unexpected surge of happiness. Maybe I'm not as hopeless as I thought. Also, I've been sleeping better. Maybe it helps that I've been going for short walks in the evening; the fresh air seems to clear my head.",
    "I've been smiling more lately. Even my friends noticed and asked if something good happened. I don't know what changed, but I'm not questioning it. I'm just glad to feel a bit more like myself. I even planned a game tournament with my friends for the weekend. For the first time in a long time, I'm looking forward to something."
